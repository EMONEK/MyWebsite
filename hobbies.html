        (1)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My favorite hobby is travelling. I like all kinds of travel:by bus, by car, by train, by boat, and travelling on foot. But I have never travel by the plane yet.
I love to travel with a group. Usually, I travel with my friends. Most of all I like to travel by bus and spend a long time at different places. First of all, it’s always nice to stay in a different place for a change. Secondly, I’m interested in seeing new sights, exploring different cultures and else. Third, I love to spend time in beautiful places and admire the beauty of the natural attractions such as waterfalls, lakes, seas and forests, valleys, hills, etc.

Travelling gives me a good opportunity to learn a lot about the history of the country I visit, to see cultural and historical places,  to meet people , to learn a lot about their traditions, customs and culture. In other words. I can expand my worldview and my mind. In the future I'm going to visit many place and countries of the world.
